Anasys Python Tools
========

Anasys Python Tools is a python package for working with files generated by Anasys Instruments' Analysis Studio software.

Basic Usage
-----------
.. code-block:: python

  import anasyspythontools as anasys
  # Read your Analysis Studio file
  f = anasys.read("afmdata.axz")
  # Grab all the height map data from the file
  heightmaps = f.HeightMaps
  # Show off your beautiful images
  heightmaps['Height 1'].show()


Features
--------

- Read and write files with .axz, .axd, and .irb file extensions
- Extract AFM spectral and height map images as numpy arrays
- Quickly display and save your data
- Use your data with popular Python data libraries and applications (Pandas, Orange3, Jupyter, etc.)
- Work with your data when you're away from your instruments

Installation
------------

For now, you must manually move the package into your python or working directory. We are working on getting pip/conda working presently and hope to have a more streamlined installation process soon!
