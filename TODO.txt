#Required
Add IRB capabilities
FIX READ/WRITE in anasysio (should return appropriate object, not just docs)
add xml, axz, axd, csv to save options (eventually hdf5?)
optionally, split save functions into save and export image or something like that
Get spectra class done
parse the rest of the AF()
split xml atributes into children before/while recursing through

#Packaging, docs, and sugar
GET PACKAGING SETUP : https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
get readthedocs hooked up: https://readthedocs.org/
create github landing page
create better file headings
transfer repo ownership to Anasys Instruments
define __help__ or __doc__ for all user-accessible classes and methods
figure out what to do with __init__.py

#Writing
Read hm or spectra in from image, csv, numpyarray, etc
insert hm or spectra into af()
write AF() to file
Default templates for HMs Spectra and AF doc types

#Testing
Write unit tests!!! Would be easier if relative imports were working , so
FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX RELATIVE IMPORTS

#Irksome
Make Auto range scaling of HeightMap._plot() better, more consistent.
Make it so numbers are not stored as strings
Spectra are too nested. Make easy top-level functions for users to pull spectra

#TESTS

Make _parent tags work.
