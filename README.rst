Anasys Python Tools
========

Anasys Python Tools is a python package for working with files generated by Anasys Instruments' Analysis Studio software.
$project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

Basic usage::
-----------

    import anasyspythontools as anasys
    # Get your stuff done
    f = anasys.read("afmdata.axz")
    # Grab all the height map data from the file
    heightmaps = f.HeightMaps
    # Show off your beautiful images
    heightmaps['Height 1'].show()


Features
--------

- Read and write files with .axz, .axd, and .irb file extensions
- Extract AFM height map images as numpy arrays
- Extract specrtal data as numpy arrays
- Quickly display and save your data
- Work with your data when you're away from your instruments

Installation
------------

For now, you must manually move the package into your python or working directory. We are working on getting pip/conda working presently and hope to have a more streamlined installation process soon!
